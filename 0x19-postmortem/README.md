**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration**: 4 hours, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact**: Affecting our web application, causing a 30% decrease in user access.
- **Root Cause**: Database connection pool exhaustion due to a surge in traffic.

**Timeline:**
- **10:00 AM (UTC)**: Issue detected through monitoring alerts.
- **10:05 AM**: Engage the incident response team to investigate.
- **10:15 AM**: Initial assumption was a network issue.
- **10:30 AM**: Network issue ruled out; attention shifted to the database.
- **11:00 AM**: Database queries reviewed, no apparent issues.
- **11:30 AM**: Realized a sudden traffic surge might be the root cause.
- **12:00 PM**: Incident escalated to the database administration team.
- **1:30 PM**: Database connection pool adjusted.
- **2:00 PM**: Issue resolved, application performance back to normal.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The root cause of the outage was the exhaustion of the database connection pool. When the traffic surge occurred, the web application opened numerous connections to the database but failed to release them properly. This led to the connection pool being entirely consumed, preventing other users from accessing the database.

To resolve the issue, we adjusted the database connection pool settings to allow for a higher number of connections. Additionally, we implemented a mechanism to better manage connection release, ensuring that connections are returned to the pool after use. This effectively prevented the pool from being exhausted in the future and improved the overall database performance.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
1. **Improved Connection Pool Management**: Enhance the database connection pool management system to automatically recycle connections that are not properly released by the application. (TODO: Implement a connection recycling mechanism within two weeks).

2. **Monitoring Alerts**: Expand the monitoring system to generate alerts when the connection pool reaches a critical threshold. (TODO: Configure additional database connection pool alerts within one week).

3. **Traffic Load Balancing**: Invest in load balancing mechanisms to distribute traffic evenly and prevent sudden surges from overwhelming the system. (TODO: Investigate load balancing solutions within one month).

4. **Documentation and Training**: Educate development teams on best practices for connection handling and the importance of proper connection release. (TODO: Conduct a training session for developers within two weeks).

5. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to ensure smoother incident response and escalation procedures in the future. (TODO: Create a disaster recovery plan within three months).

By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to strengthen our system's resilience and responsiveness to traffic surges and minimize the likelihood of a similar outage occurring in the future. This postmortem has shed light on the importance of not only monitoring but also optimizing resource allocation to accommodate unexpected traffic spikes effectively.
